# Welcome to vesselEfficiency-0.1! 

vesselEfficiency is a modelica library, that is in ongoing development, which allows for the description, parameterisation, documentation and simulation of complex maritime systems.


## Compatibility
	
vesselEfficiency-0.1 has been tested and is guaranteed to work with Dymola 2017, so please make the effort to update to this version of Dymola to ensure no problems occur due to out of date dependencies.


## Getting Started

To get started with vesselEfficiency, start Dymola and then perform the tasks "File > Open..." and then navigate to where you have saved "VesselEfficiency.MO". You should now see "VesselEfficiency" within your package browser. Open the overall tree and then navigate to "Information > OverviewLibrary" (Switch to the documentation view). This section provides a brief summary of the library and its components.


## Examples

Two ready-made examples are available in the "Examples" section of the library which can be simulated straight away:

1. Single propulsion vessel: simplified calculations and visual experience.
2. Single propulsion vessel with LabView link: simplified calculations and visual experience with UDP sender to LabView.


Development and Contribution

All feedback and contributions are welcome to the ongoing development of vesselEfficiency via a pull request or @vesselEfficiency.
